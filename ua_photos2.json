However, after invitations had been sent out, the foundry casting the statue notified the university that it would not be ready in time. Not wanting to postpone the ceremony, Georgetown officials ordered a plaster cast of the statue, which was painted brown and duly unveiled in front of thousands. In 1940, Brother James Harrington, who was in charge of workmen on the campus in 1912, recalled that: 'Weeks later, in the dead of night, today's bronze statue was substituted for the spurious one and no one was the wiser.'"},{"label":"Date Created","value":"1912-05-04"},{"label":"subject","value":"John Carroll"},{"label":"subject","value":"Carroll, John"},{"label":"subject","value":"Statue of John Carroll"},{"label":"subject","value":"Statues"},{"label":"subject","value":"Carroll statue -- history of"}],"images":[{"resource":{"@type":"dctypes:Image","service":{"profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554462/bitstream_9843.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json"},"format":"image/jpeg","width":2048,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554462/bitstream_9843.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg","height":1536},"@type":"oa:Annotation","motivation":"sc:painting","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Image/bitstream_9843.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json","on":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/ead"}],"@type":"sc:Canvas","width":2048,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Canvas/bitstream_9843.jpg","label":"Unveiling ceremony for the statue of John Carroll at the main entrance to Georgetown University","height":1536},{"metadata":[{"label":"name","value":"bitstream_10719.jpg"},{"label":"Digital Georgetown","value":"<a href='http://hdl.handle.net/10822/554900'>Item Page<\/a>"},{"label":"Description","value":""},{"label":"Date Created","value":"1912-06"},{"label":"subject","value":"Nursing School -- Georgetown University"},{"label":"subject","value":"Nursing School -- class of 1912"}],"images":[{"resource":{"@type":"dctypes:Image","service":{"profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554900/bitstream_10719.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json"},"format":"image/jpeg","width":2048,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554900/bitstream_10719.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg","height":1536},"@type":"oa:Annotation","motivation":"sc:painting","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Image/bitstream_10719.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json","on":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/ead"}],"@type":"sc:Canvas","width":2048,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Canvas/bitstream_10719.jpg","label":"Georgetown University School of Nursing Class of 1912","height":1536},{"metadata":[{"label":"name","value":"bitstream_10721.jpg"},{"label":"Digital Georgetown","value":"<a href='http://hdl.handle.net/10822/554901'>Item Page<\/a>"},{"label":"Description","value":""},{"label":"Date Created","value":"1912-11-17"},{"label":"subject","value":"Nursing School -- Georgetown University"}],"images":[{"resource":{"@type":"dctypes:Image","service":{"profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554901/bitstream_10721.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json"},"format":"image/jpeg","width":2048,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554901/bitstream_10721.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg","height":1536},"@type":"oa:Annotation","motivation":"sc:painting","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Image/bitstream_10721.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json","on":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/ead"}],"@type":"sc:Canvas","width":2048,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Canvas/bitstream_10721.jpg","label":"Georgetown University nursing students in classroom","height":1536},{"metadata":[{"label":"name","value":"bitstream_10367.jpg"},{"label":"Digital Georgetown","value":"<a href='http://hdl.handle.net/10822/554724'>Item Page<\/a>"},{"label":"Description","value":"Pictured in the center of the last row is Edmund A.

In 1920, he was the National Pentathlon Champion.  He also accumulated the largest points total in the pentathlon at the Inter-Allied Athletic Games held in Paris at the end of World War I.  In March 1920, he broke his foot but still qualified for the pentathlon and decathlon at the Olympic tryouts.  At the Games, he finished fourth in the pentathlon despite that fact that his foot was not fully healed.  After graduating from Georgetown in 1922, LeGendre considered an acting career. Although his training had been limited, he again qualified for the Olympics in 1924.  He  placed third in the pentathlon, setting a new world record for the broad jump of 25 feet 6 inches in the process.  Ironically, he had failed to qualify in that individual event at the U.S. Olympic tryouts. LeGendre became a Lieutenant in the Naval Dental Corps after receiving a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from Georgetown in 1927.

The common denominator in these buildings was 'the undulating exterior wall surface and the profusion of vertical elements' and Warnecke wanted to recognize these aspects in the design of the library with 'an irregular outline and a pronounced vertical emphasis.'  Architectural concrete was to be Warnecke's basic exterior material. In May 1966, he wrote: 'The material of the new library will incorporate dark gray granite aggregate similar in color to Healy Hall and similar in color intensity to the foliage of the trees on the hillside below. It will blend quietly into the existing landscape of buildings and trees, balancing the older structures that extend immediately to the west of Healy Hall.'"},{"label":"Date Created","value":"1966"},{"label":"subject","value":"Lauinger Library"},{"label":"subject","value":"John Carl Warnecke"}],"images":[{"resource":{"@type":"dctypes:Image","service":{"profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554441/bitstream_9801.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json"},"format":"image/jpeg","width":2048,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554441/bitstream_9801.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg","height":1536},"@type":"oa:Annotation","motivation":"sc:painting","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Image/bitstream_9801.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json","on":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/ead"}],"@type":"sc:Canvas","width":2048,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Canvas/bitstream_9801.jpg","label":"Model for a new library at Georgetown University by John Carl Warnecke and Associates","height":1536},{"metadata":[{"label":"name","value":"bitstream_10283.jpg"},{"label":"Digital Georgetown","value":"<a href='http://hdl.handle.net/10822/554682'>Item Page<\/a>"},{"label":"Description","value":""},{"label":"Date Created","value":"1966-03-25"},{"label":"subject","value":"Founders Day"},{"label":"subject","value":"Hubert H.
