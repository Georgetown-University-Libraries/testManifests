He was 13 years old when he enrolled. He went on to find fame as a stage and film actor and is perhaps best remembered for his Shakespearean roles.  A 'Georgetown College Journal' article from February 1933 quotes an interview with him in which he says that, when he first arrived at Georgetown, \u201ca priest took me through the buildings.

Their product, massive in scale, is 312 feet long and 95 feet wide with a clock tower that rises 200 feet.  With Healy Hall\u2019s opening, the University doubled the total square footage of its buildings. Healy was the first of our buildings to face the city rather than the river and it has been suggested that Patrick F. Healy, S.J., who planned the building, deliberately oriented it as a signal that Georgetown should be viewed, from that point on, as an educational institution of national importance."},{"label":"Subject(s)","value":"Healy Hall; J.C.

A grand unveiling ceremony was planned for May 4, 1912. Chief Justice Edward Douglass White, who had been a student at Georgetown from 1857 to 1860, was to make the presentation speech and Cardinal Gibbons, Attorney General George F. Wickersham who was representing President Taft, Speaker of the House Champ Clark, and Baron Hengelmuller, Ambassador from Austria-Hungary and Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, were also slated to speak. However, after invitations had been sent out, the foundry casting the statue notified the university that it would not be ready in time.

In March 1920, he broke his foot but still qualified for the pentathlon and decathlon at the Olympic tryouts.  At the Games, he finished fourth in the pentathlon despite that fact that his foot was not fully healed.  After graduating from Georgetown in 1922, LeGendre considered an acting career. Although his training had been limited, he again qualified for the Olympics in 1924.  He  placed third in the pentathlon, setting a new world record for the broad jump of 25 feet 6 inches in the process.  Ironically, he had failed to qualify in that individual event at the U.S. Olympic tryouts.

The honorary degree ceremony took place in Gaston Hall, with the audience limited to the senior class. After the degree had been conferred, the class honored the Cardinal with a variation of the college cheer which was normally delivered at sporting events as: 'Hoya, Hoya, Saxa! Hoya, Hoya, Georgetown! -Team, Team, Team!'  John G. Bowen (LL.B. 1921, LL.M. 1922, Ph.D. 1933), describes the Cardinal\u2019s reaction in the 1966 compilation, \u201cOn the Hilltop: Reflections and Reminiscences on their Campus Years by Georgetown Alumni\u201d, noting that 'The Cardinal had just come from Paris and seen the turbulence of shouting students in the area of the Sorbonne . . . At the instant the future pope finished his speech, up rose the President of the Yard [the College\u2019s student government]. Waving his fist high, he shouted, \u201cOK fellows. Hit it!\u201d Every man jumped to his feet . . . the Cardinal\u2019s eyes bugged out as he sat terrified. The whole class thundered: \u201cHoya, Hoya, Saxa! Hoya, Hoya Georgetown! Hoya Pacelli, Pacelli, Pacelli!\u201d and broke into vigorous applause. The Cardinal smiled. Afterward in the President\u2019s office he said: \u201cI think I will start something new. This will be the cheer of the College of Cardinals.\u201d   In 1939, Cardinal Pacelli was elevated to the Papacy as Pius XII."},{"label":"Subject(s)","value":"Faculty; Honorary degree; Papal Secretary of State"},{"label":"Rights","value":"All Rights Reserved by Georgetown University Library."},{"label":"Permanent URL","value":"<a href='http://hdl.handle.net/10822/554587'>http://hdl.handle.net/10822/554587<\/a>"}],"images":[{"resource":{"@type":"dctypes:Image","service":{"profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554587/bitstream_10093.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json"},"format":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554587/bitstream_10093.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg","height":750},"@type":"oa:Annotation","motivation":"sc:painting","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Image/bitstream_10093.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json","on":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/ead"}],"@type":"sc:Canvas","width":1000,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Canvas/bitstream_10093.jpg","label":"Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli receives an honorary degree from Georgetown University","height":750},{"metadata":[{"label":"Title","value":"Students sunning themselves on the roof of Copley Hall at Georgetown University"},{"label":"Date Created","value":"1937"},{"label":"Creator","value":"Unknown"},{"label":"Description","value":"Among those pictured: John F.

The common denominator in these buildings was 'the undulating exterior wall surface and the profusion of vertical elements' and Warnecke wanted to recognize these aspects in the design of the library with 'an irregular outline and a pronounced vertical emphasis.'  Architectural concrete was to be Warnecke's basic exterior material. In May 1966, he wrote: 'The material of the new library will incorporate dark gray granite aggregate similar in color to Healy Hall and similar in color intensity to the foliage of the trees on the hillside below. It will blend quietly into the existing landscape of buildings and trees, balancing the older structures that extend immediately to the west of Healy Hall.'"},{"label":"Subject(s)","value":"Lauinger Library; John Carl Warnecke"},{"label":"Rights","value":"All Rights Reserved by Georgetown University Library."},{"label":"Permanent URL","value":"<a href='http://hdl.handle.net/10822/554441'>http://hdl.handle.net/10822/554441<\/a>"}],"images":[{"resource":{"@type":"dctypes:Image","service":{"profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554441/bitstream_9801.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json"},"format":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/ua_photos/10822-554441/bitstream_9801.jpg/full/full/0/default.jpg","height":750},"@type":"oa:Annotation","motivation":"sc:painting","@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Image/bitstream_9801.jpg","@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json","on":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/ead"}],"@type":"sc:Canvas","width":1000,"@id":"https://repository-dev.library.georgetown.edu/loris/Canvas/bitstream_9801.jpg","label":"Model for a new library at Georgetown University by John Carl Warnecke and Associates","height":750},{"metadata":[{"label":"Title","value":"Vice President Hubert Humphrey speaks from the porch of the Old North Building at Georgetown University on Founders' Day"},{"label":"Date Created","value":"1966-03-25"},{"label":"Creator","value":"Georgetown University News Service"},{"label":"Description","value":""},{"label":"Subject(s)","value":"Founders Day; Hubert H.
